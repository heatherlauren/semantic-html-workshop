<p>Welcome to the future of learning</p>
<div id="about">
<p>Gaza Sky Geeks runs tuition-free coding bootcamp in Gaza. We transform talented individuals from a variety of academic and professional backgrounds into sought-after software developers. All of our graduates find well-paid employment in software development or a related field.</p>
<p>Our revolutionary peer-led programme begins with a 16-week immersion in full-stack JavaScript, Node.js, and Git. Working collaboratively in pairs and teams, students master the fundamentals of &#34;agile&#34; development practices by delivering real projects to clients such as early-stage startups and NGOs.</p>
<p>Instead of traditional top-down instruction, Gaza Sky Geeks has mentors&#45;former students who work from the Gaza Sky Geeks co-working space on freelance projects until they are ready to seek full-time employment.</p>

<p>Programme schedule</p>
<div id="coders">
<p>The programme consists of a 16-week foundation followed by up to 10 weeks of working on real-world projects.</p>
<p>Classes are peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns delivering seminars, running code reviews and managing projects.</p>
<p>Our curriculum primarily covers test-driven development, using JavaScript and Node.js. We also cover aspects of UX design, product management and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>After graduation, we aim to help our students find freelance projects, so that they can hone their skills, build a project portfolio and mentor the next cohort of students</p>

<p>Our Story</p>
<div id="ourStory">
<p>Gaza Sky Geeks is the leading co-working space, startup accelerator, and technology education hub in Gaza. We bring together online freelancers, outsourcers, and startup founders together under one roof to share ideas, learn, innovate, code, and geek out!</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>GSG was launched with the recognition that consistent access to high-speed fiber internet could allow Gazaâ€™s highly educated youth to side-step many of the current restrictions on the movement of people and goods that hamper the Gazan economy.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011 in partnership with Google and the international NGO Mercy Corps, we began by holding the first Startup Weekends in Gaza and expanding education about tech entrepreneurship. In 2014, we began working with individual startup founders to grow their businesses outside of Gaza and to develop our own incubation curriculum. In 2014 and 2015, we facilitated the first venture investments into Gazan startups.</p>
